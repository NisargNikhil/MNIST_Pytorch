Project Title:

MNIST data  using Pytorch

About:

This model uses multilayer perceptron over the gray scale images to predict the number between 0 to 9.

Dataset used:

The Dataset is one of the most popular data dataset available on the internet to deal with the gray scale. The data 
gives about 60000 gray scale images having dimension (1,28,28).It is then fed into Neural network with two hidden 
layers and avout 10 epochs been done. Validation data is also tested sideways for skewness. 

Library used:

Torch
Numpy
matplotlib.pyplot
torch.nn
sklearn
torchvision
PIL.ImageOps
